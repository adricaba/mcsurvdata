"Processed gene expression data and clinical information of six breast cancer cohorts","Processed gene expression data and clinical data of 2294 patients from six breast cancer studies. These include GSE1456, GSE2034, GSE2990, GSE3494, GSE7390 and the metabric. Normalization is done by adjusting each gene by technical covariates using a mixed effects model. Data merging is done by standardizing the gene expression matrix of GSE1456, GSE2034, GSE2990, GSE3494 and GS7390 to a reference dataset (metabric). Only ER+ samples are included.
